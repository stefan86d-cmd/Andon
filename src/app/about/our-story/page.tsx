                        From the heart of Helsinki, Finland, AndonPro was born out of decades of hands-on experience on the factory floor. We're a small, passionate team that has lived and breathed the production environment, witnessing firsthand the communication breakdowns, the costly downtimes, and the daily frustrations that chip away at efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                        We saw a gap. Existing solutions were often overly complex, rigid, and priced out of reach for smaller businesses. We knew there had to be a better wayâ€”a tool that was both powerful and accessible. That's why we decided to build AndonPro: an intuitive, affordable platform designed to solve the very issues we faced.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                        Our core philosophy is simple: empower the user. We believe that the people on the line are the experts, which is why our app is built for ease of use and complete customization. Whether you're a small workshop or a large-scale operation, AndonPro adapts to your unique workflow, not the other way around.
